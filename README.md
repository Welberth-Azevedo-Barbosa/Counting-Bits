# Counting-Bits
Solution for "Leetcode 338. Counting Bits"

# Description

This Python class, named "Solution", provides an efficient solution for counting the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of integers within a specified range (from 0 to a given number "num"). The algorithm utilizes dynamic programming to calculate the bit counts, resulting in an optimized and faster computation.
